Task 7 feedback:

Test task 7

(1) I have removed the toHaveLength from the test.
expect(typeof comment).toBe("object")
expect(Object.keys(comment)).toHaveLength(6)

controller:
(2) I have removed one of the postComment functions.
Is there a reason there are two postComment functions defined here?

(3) Code removed - lesson learnt.
This is not how we should be dealing with errors. Have a re-read of the notes on how this should be done instead:

(4) I have removed the async and try catch.
(same as the above) is mixing async await and promises together. I would recommend sticking to one for consistency and readability.

(5) Added tests: username does not exist, article does not exist, and invalid article_id

There are a few other errors that should be included here as well:

What should happen when all of the properties exist, but the username given does not exist?
E.g { username: "IDontExist" body: "a comment with a username that doesnt exist", }

What should happen when requesting to post a comment on an article that doesnt exist?
E.g /api/articles/9999/comments

What should happen when requesting to post a comment on an invalid article_id?
E.g /api/articles/banana/comments
